# Programming solution of different Data Structure and Algorithm problemes

1.Write program(s) that behave like’wc’, a unix utility that display the count of characters, words and lines present in a file. If no file is specified it reads from the standard input. If more than one file name is specified it displays the counts for each file along with the filename. Ensure your program is documented and readable, takes care of data validation with appropriate error messages and gives a well formatted output.

2.Suppose you are given a stack of n pancakes of different sizes. You want to sort the pancakes so that smaller pancakes are on top of larger pancakes. The only operation you can perform is a flip—insert a spatula under the top k pancakes, for some integer k between 1 and n, and flip them all over. Describe an algorithm to sort an arbitrary stack of n pancakes using as few flips as possible. Exactly how many flips does your algorithm perform in the worst case?
